# Rambling Recipes

Strip out the boring old ingredients from recipe sites and enjoy the meandering stories.

There are plenty of ways to overbuild a joke site. This is one way. I freely admit simply regex'ing for likely elements and removing them isn't the best way to truly find and remove recipes from a website, but it's built using an OOP foundation I wouldn't hate using for a real project.
